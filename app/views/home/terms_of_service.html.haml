      ##Terms of service
      
      We (the folks on [Project MyUSA](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/MyUSA/team/)) created a cool new service to simplify the process of interacting with government services online called "MyUSA", and would *love* for you to use it. The service is entirely free and although it integrates with other government and non-government websites, is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on as possible. 
      
      That said, we're still working some of the kinks out, and ultimately you're responsible for ensuring that the information you submit to agencies is accurate. We hope that you'll use MyUSA as much as possible, but please remember that MyUSA is a shared service. (So don't do anything that might interfere with it's ability to serve other users.)
      
      Please be sure to read this agreement carefully before using this website or its related services. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use the services it provides.
      
      ### Generally
      
      MyUSA ("the Service") provides users with a persistent online persona to interact with government services.  This service is offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the MyUSA Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Agreement"). The Service is made available to individuals who are at least 18 years of age.
      
      ### Scope
      
      All of the services, content, documentation, code and related materials made available to you through the the Service are subject to these terms. Access to or use of the Service or its content, whether directly or programmatically (e.g., via an application programming interface (API) or third-party application), constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.
      
      ### Use
      
      You may use any MyUSA service directly or via third-party applications to store profile and related information, and to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view or otherwise "get" any information made available by the Service.
      
      ### Your account
      
      If you create a MyUSA account (or log in to the Service using a third-party login), you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and are fully responsible for the activities that occur under the account and any actions taken therein. You must immediately notify MyUSA of any unauthorized use of your account or breaches of security. MyUSA will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
      
      ### The information You submit
      
      The information you submit will remain private to you, unless you explicitly authorize an application or agency to use it at the time. It is your responsibility to ensure the information submitted to agencies and other government entities, by you or on your behalf, is and remains factual, complete, and accurate.
      
      ### Attribution
      
      All applications which utilize or access the Service should display the following notice prominently within the application: “Powered by MyUSA”.  You may use the MyUSA name or logos in order to identify the source of the content or Service subject to these rules.  You may not use the MyUSA name, logo, or the like to imply endorsement of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise. MyUSA will not be liable for any false statements or misrepresentations made by you or on your behalf as a result of your use of the Service.
      
      ### Modification or false representation of content

      ### Right to limit
      
      Your use of the Service may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by MyUSA.

      ### Service termination
